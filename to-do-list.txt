# before open wallet:
 - make a config file
   > stores 1st time using program or not
   > default .wallet directory
 - make logger to check error while running program
 - check config file
 
1. open wallet:
  - if password is wrong, catch the exception but do not terminate the program. Just pass and show error msg
2. create wallet
3. import wallet
4. look for .wallet file in the defualt directory (maybe to use it as a default path when opening a existing wallet so the use
does not have to navigate and look for wallet file everytime)

5.Send transaction:
 * send transaction is working now, but few more things to add:
 	- check available balance (send + fee < available balance else don't send)
 	- check address valid or not (use address length to check and the initial 4 letters)
 	- include payment ID
 	- maybe make adjust fee, no less than 0.1

6. backup wallet
7. change wallet when there is a .wallet file open currently
8. check how to properly close wallet and daemon thread when closing the program
