local turtle explorer (turtle completo)

Turtle completo is a project that aims to combine the [local turtle explorer](https://github.com/yumingchangsabodota/local-turtle-explorer) and the turtlecoin wallet. From now on the local turtle explorer will move to here, "turtle-completo".

We have rewritten the local explorer using Python and the kivy framework. It is just a personal project trying out different GUI modules. 
Kivy was chosen because of its crossplatform feature. 

Currently we have only Windows release available, however, since Kivy is a crossplatform module, you shall be able to make some necessary change and modify it if you would like to compile the code for systems such as Linux or MacOS.


For those who aren't tech savy, just download the executable from the release:
[Download the release file here](https://github.com/yumingchangsabodota/turtle-completo/releases)

[Here is a demo video of the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_5qlIJxFYo&t=15s)

The turtle wallet is still under development, it might take longer to release a final product as I can only code on my free time.

Please let me know or submit a new issue to [here](https://github.com/yumingchangsabodota/turtle-completo/issues) if you find any in the software.

If you are interested in developing the turtle wallet for turtle completo, fee free to contact me. 


### To be a good turtle, you must explore locally!
